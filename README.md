# Improved detection resolution of PRRSV using nanopore direct RNA sequencing and bioinformatics tools

This repository provides relavant bioinformatics methods and codes for the manuscript: Improved detection resolution of PRRSV using nanopore direct RNA sequencing and bioinformatics tools. 

The objective of this study is to provide a high-resoluation detecion method for PRRSV diagnosis, and to pave the way for the future goal of  rapid, unbiased, on-site infectious diseases investigation using portable sequencer. The technology we used in this study was Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (https://nanoporetech.com/).

Raw sequencing data generated was deposited in NCBI SRA:

## PRRSV whole genome generation
Basecalling of raw reads was performed using Albacore (https://nanoporetech.com/) to generate FASTQ files. 

Total yield, total reads, read quality, and read length from whole genome sequencing were analyzed using NanoPlot (https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot).

In order to evaluate the raw error rates of direct RNA sequencing, raw reads were 
### Raw reads assessment 

### Whole genome generation

### Coverage analysis
